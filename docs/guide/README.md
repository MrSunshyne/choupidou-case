I'll do you one better: **Why** ?

## Origins

For almost a decade now, we have been familiar with the choupidou slang,especially in the landscape of Mauritius. Some say it was a language given to us in heritage before the demise of mobile phones with physical keyboards.

## Conflicted History

Over the years, this dialect was made fun by intellectuals but at the same time was used by free souls in order to embed both emotion and meaning in words. As if the words were being spoken and could convey expressions ! 

## Technological usefulness

Another facinating facet(see what I did there?) of the choupidou case was it's ability to reduce the length of words, hence saving space, without loosing meaning or removing the embeded emotions. 

That was precisely why, choupidou-case is perfect for programming, it retains context while performing human readable compression.
